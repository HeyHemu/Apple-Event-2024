Tim Cook: Good morning! Welcome to Apple Park! Today we're going to talk about Apple Watch, AirPods, and iPhone,
2:39
and the profound impact these products are making in our lives. Thanks to their advanced technologies and seamless integration of hardware,
2:47
software, and services, they deliver experiences powerfully and intuitively, helping us stay healthy, connected, productive, and entertained.
2:58
For years, artificial intelligence and machine learning have been essential
3:04
in delivering so many of the features and experiences you love. In June, we launched Apple Intelligence,
3:11
our powerful new personal intelligence system, which will have an incredible impact.
3:18
Today, we have exciting announcements to share about Apple Watch and AirPods.
3:24
And we are thrilled to introduce the first iPhones designed from the ground up for Apple Intelligence and its breakthrough capabilities.
3:33
Let's start with Apple Watch. Apple Watch has deeply impacted the lives of millions of people around the world.
3:41
It's helped them stay active, healthy, and connected right from their wrist, and it's helped save countless lives along the way.
3:49
I receive messages every day from users telling me how Apple Watch makes their lives better, in ways both big and small.
3:59
The impact Apple Watch has made on so many people around the world is the result of constant innovation.
4:07
Every year, we add features and capabilities that not long ago would have seemed impossible to fit into a single device,
4:15
let alone one small enough to wear on your wrist! Today we're building on the advanced technologies
4:22
pioneered with Apple Watch to make it even more useful, essential, and intelligent.
4:28
And we're doing it all in this beautiful new design.

Introducing Apple Watch Series 10, with our biggest display and thinnest design ever!
5:27
Here's Jeff to tell you all about it. ♪ ♪
5:43
Jeff Williams: Apple Watch is an indispensable companion, and the display is central to everything you do with it.
5:50
From discreetly checking the time, to scanning a notification, to a quick glance at your workout metrics,
5:56
how easily you can read the screen is crucial. That's why, for Series 10, we developed the largest
6:04
and most advanced display ever for Apple Watch. It's the biggest wearable display we've ever built,
6:10
even slightly bigger than Apple Watch Ultra! And compared to previous generations, it has up to 30% more screen area!
6:19
With a larger screen, you can increase the font size without sacrificing content. And you can see an additional line of text in apps like Messages, Mail, or News.
6:30
It also makes it easier to type a message, enter your passcode, or pause your workout.
6:36
Both the display and the case have more rounded corners and a wider aspect ratio,
6:41
which makes Series 10 appear softer, sleeker, and more streamlined. The front crystal of Series 10 is made of durable Ion-X glass,
6:50
and extends further down the sides of the case, creating an expansive top view.
6:56
Under the front crystal is Apple's first-ever Wide-angle OLED Display.
7:03
Each pixel has been optimized to emit more light at wider angles.
7:08
Often, you look at your watch from an angle, like while you're walking, typing on a keyboard, or when your hand is resting in your lap.
7:16
So we made the display on Series 10 up to 40% brighter when viewed from an angle, which improves visibility
7:24
and makes it easier to read your watch with a quick glance. We also developed Wide-angle OLEDs to be extremely power efficient,
7:33
which allows the display to update once a second in Always-On mode, instead of just once a minute.
7:39
Now, a ticking seconds hand is visible even when your wrist is down.
7:44
It makes Series 10 feel more alive, all of the time. You can see the effect on Flux, a bold new watch face
7:52
that takes full advantage of the large display, filling the screen with color second by second.
7:58
It was designed to complement Series 10's new aluminum finishes, starting with Jet Black!
8:05
It's our first-ever polished aluminum finish for Apple Watch. This deep, glossy black was developed specifically for Series 10.
8:15
The case is made from our durable aluminum alloy and polished using silica nanoparticles
8:21
until the surface achieves a reflective shine. Then it goes through a 30-step anodization process,
8:30
which bonds organic dye to the housing at a molecular level.
8:35
Joining Jet Black is a beautiful, warm Rose Gold, along with our ever-popular Silver aluminum.
8:42
The comfort of Apple Watch is so important because you wear it day and night.
8:48
For anything you wear continuously, comfort is a function of size, shape, and weight.
8:54
And on your wrist, every millimeter and every gram matters. That's why we pushed the limits of technology
9:01
to make Series 10 the thinnest Apple Watch ever! At just 9.7 mm, it's nearly 10% thinner than Series 9,
9:10
a significant reduction considering how compact Apple Watch already is. Achieving this radically thinner profile required further miniaturization
9:19
of several already tiny internal modules like the SiP, Digital Crown, and speaker.
9:26
The speaker system was completely re-engineered to be 30% smaller without any compromise to acoustic performance.
9:34
And, for the first time on Apple Watch, you can play media like music or podcasts directly through the speaker.
9:41
It's great for when you don't have your AirPods handy. Also contributing to Series 10's thinner design is an innovative metal back
9:49
that fully integrates the antenna into the housing itself, combining two layers into one.
9:55
A thin isolation split encircles the metal back for great cellular performance.
10:02
And it's bonded to a watertight layer that maintains 50-meter water resistance, so you can still shower, swim, and surf.
10:10
The new metal back also accommodates a larger and more efficient charging coil,
10:15
making Series 10 the fastest-charging Apple Watch ever! In just 30 minutes, you can get up to 80% battery,
10:24
making it easier to charge your watch whenever it fits into your day. The smaller speaker, metal back, and other innovations
10:32
make Series 10 not only thinner but also lighter weight.
10:37
Aluminum cases weigh up to 10% less than the previous generation. And we're introducing another lightweight material
10:45
in a gorgeous new finish, polished Titanium. This year, Grade 5 Titanium replaces stainless steel.
10:53
With Titanium's remarkable strength-to-weight ratio, Series 10 weighs almost 20% less than the stainless steel Series 9.
11:02
The case is made of aerospace-grade Titanium that's polished to a mirror-like shine, then PVD-coated
11:10
in one of three stunning colors: Natural, Gold, and a dark Slate Gray.
11:16
And we've updated the elegant Milanese Loop and classic Link Bracelet to perfectly match the Titanium finishes.
11:24
The uninterrupted lines of case, back, and watch band celebrate the beauty of metal.
11:30
To complete the metallic look, the Reflections face has an intricate, shimmering dial that reacts subtly to your movements
11:38
and transitions gracefully to Always-On mode. The sleek shape, expansive display, sapphire front crystal,
11:46
and sophisticated finishes make Series 10 the most refined expression of Apple Watch yet.
11:53
Titanium Series 10 joins the lineup as our next carbon neutral product!
11:59
It's made with 95% recycled titanium and manufactured with 100% renewable electricity.
12:06
And to reduce emissions from transportation, we prioritize non-air shipping.
12:12
Of course, inside Series 10 is custom Apple silicon, which powers all the incredible capabilities of every Apple Watch.
12:21
The new S10 SiP is designed for performance, power efficiency, and intelligence.
12:27
Its 4-core Neural Engine quickly processes machine learning tasks and uses advanced transformer models to power the intelligent features
12:35
you already use every day, like double tap, on-device Siri, dictation, and automatic workout detection.
12:43
Plus, it enables Crash Detection and Fall Detection, which uses machine learning to identify the motion signatures
12:50
and impact forces that occur during slips, trips, and falls. And, to improve phone calls, Series 10 uses a new neural network
13:00
to suppress background noise, so you sound clear and crisp on the other end, even in noisy environments
13:07
like a crowded restaurant, city street, or windy day. watchOS 11 brings even more intelligence to Apple Watch.
13:15
Now, the Smart Stack automatically adds new widgets right when you need them.
13:20
The new Photos face uses machine learning to identify, score, and curate the best photos from your library.
13:28
And the Translate app comes to Apple Watch, using machine learning for speech recognition
13:33
and rapid translation. Of course, intelligence powers many of the health features on Apple Watch as well.
13:40
Here's Sumbul to tell you more. ♪ ♪
13:52
Dr. Sumbul Ahmad Desai: With the compact design of Series 10, plus the fastest charging ever, it's so easy to wear your Apple Watch day and night,
13:59
unlocking insightful and intelligent features for your health. Your Apple Watch can remind you to take your medications
14:06
and alert you to loud environments that could impact your hearing. It can also notify you if your heart shows signs of atrial fibrillation,
14:13
and we hear stories nearly every day about the impact these irregular rhythm notifications have had
14:20
in helping users seek and receive critical care. While you're sleeping, Apple Watch can measure wrist temperature
14:27
to detect when you likely ovulated, identify changes in your daily health status with the new Vitals app,
14:33
and determine how much time you spend in each sleep stage. And now, Series 10 can also alert you to a major health condition
14:41
that impacts over a billion people worldwide: sleep apnea.
14:46
It's a potentially serious condition where breathing stops repeatedly and causes disrupted sleep.
14:52
Sleep plays such a vital role in our overall health and well-being, and people with sleep apnea can experience excessive daytime tiredness,
15:00
have difficulties concentrating, and be more irritable. If left untreated, sleep apnea can also have
15:07
significant consequences on your health, including increased risk of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and cardiac issues.
15:15
But one of the biggest challenges is that 80% of people with sleep apnea are undiagnosed,
15:20
so they don't know they have the condition. To detect sleep apnea, Apple Watch uses the accelerometer
15:26
to monitor a new metric during sleep called Breathing Disturbances. You can view your nightly values in the Health app,
15:33
which can also help you understand the restfulness of your sleep. Every 30 days, Apple Watch will analyze your Breathing Disturbance data
15:40
and notify you if it shows consistent signs of moderate to severe sleep apnea.
15:46
As always, your data is secured in the Health app, which will tell you when sleep apnea may have occurred
15:51
and provide education on the importance of speaking with your healthcare provider, plus a detailed report to support that conversation.
15:59
The detection algorithm was developed using advanced machine learning with an extensive data set of clinical-grade sleep apnea tests.
16:06
It was then validated in a clinical study, unprecedented in size for sleep apnea technology.
16:12
We are so excited about the incredible impact this feature can make for the millions of people living with undiagnosed sleep apnea.
16:20
We expect clearance from the FDA and other regulators very soon, with availability in over 150 countries and regions this month,
16:28
including the U.S., Europe, and Japan. In addition to Series 10, sleep apnea notifications will
16:34
also be available on Series 9 and Ultra 2. Like health, fitness is one of the core benefits of Apple Watch.
16:40
To tell you more about what's new, here's Julz. ♪ ♪
16:52
Julz Arney: Apple Watch helps keep you active. The Activity rings motivate millions of people every day
16:58
to take a walk, hit the gym, or go for a ride. And the redesign of Series 10 makes it even better for workouts.
17:06
Runners, cyclists, and athletes of all kinds will appreciate the lighter weight. And it's easy to read your workout metrics on the bigger display.
17:15
This year, Series 10 gets a built-in depth gauge and a water temperature sensor, making it even better for activities in and around the water.
17:24

17:31
along with water temperature, which is also visible in the Workout app for pool and open water swims.
17:38
These new capabilities make Series 10 perfect for snorkeling, a popular way to explore the underwater world.
17:44
This year, Huish Outdoors is bringing their Oceanic+ app to Series 10
17:49
with features designed specifically for snorkeling, like the ability to track time, max depth,
17:55
direction, and other metrics underwater. For activities like surfing, fishing, or simply playing in the waves,
18:03
we're introducing the Tides app in watchOS 11. It shows seven days of information including rising, falling,
18:10
high and low tides, sunrise and sunset. And there's data for coastlines all over the world.
18:17
For kayakers, canoers, and rowers, the Workout app now shows distance, speed, and gives you a route map.
18:24
And with the Paddle Logger app, you can create a float plan and rely on haptic feedback from your Apple Watch to stay on course.

27:01
Kate Bergeron: AirPods 4 build on the original industry-defining design loved by millions of people
27:06
to set an entirely new bar for fit and comfort. The geometry of our ears is unique to each one of us.
27:14
And creating one shape that naturally fits people around the world is a significant challenge.
27:20
We used advanced modeling tools like 3D photogrammetry and laser topography to build an unparalleled data set.
27:28
We precisely mapped and analyzed thousands of ear shapes, generating over 50 million individual data points.
27:36
This helped us refine the design to create our most comfortable AirPods ever.
27:42
These also have incredible technology powered by the H2 chip,

33:11
and the longest battery life. And now, we're adding profound new benefits
33:16
that can expand the role AirPods play in our lives. Here's Sumbul to tell you more.
33:23
Sumbul: At Apple, we believe that technology can help you live a healthier life. And we're excited to enable incredible new health capabilities
33:32
for people around the world with AirPods Pro. Hearing is an essential part of how so many of us communicate
33:39
and experience the people and the world around us. But hearing loss can significantly affect these important experiences
33:46
and relationships, impacting your quality of life. The World Health Organization estimates
33:52
that more than 1.5 billion people are living with hearing loss. If left unaddressed, this can affect your short- and long-term health,
34:01
including increased risk of cognitive decline, falls, and social isolation,
34:06
which contributes to depression. And all of these factors can impact your longevity as well.
34:13
Over the last several years, we've developed important building blocks in this space with the Noise app on Apple Watch,
34:19
headphone audio exposure on iPhone, and the Apple Hearing Study– with over 160,000 participants, it's one of the largest studies of its kind.
34:29
Through this work we've gained deeper insights into the issues surrounding hearing health,
34:34
which inspired us to do even more. So today, we're introducing three major health features
34:41
for AirPods Pro 2, focused on prevention, awareness, and assistance.
34:47
Let's start with prevention. One in three people are regularly exposed to environmental noise levels
34:53
that could impact their hearing. To put this into perspective, there are all kinds of sounds that can be concerning in daily life.
35:00
Whether that's commuting, mowing the lawn at home, or when you're headed to that next event.
35:08
The more you're exposed, the more it can impact your hearing. To help our users minimize their exposure,
35:14
we're adding Hearing Protection to AirPods Pro, on by default, across listening modes.
35:20
The ear tips help to provide passive noise reduction. Whether you're attending a live show or playing at the show,
35:27
machine learning on the H2 chip actively reduces louder, more intermittent noise at 48,000 times per second.
35:37
Hearing Protection can help you across a variety of loud environments, preserving the entire dynamic range of what you're listening to.
35:45
Next, let's talk about awareness. Because hearing loss often worsens gradually, it can be really hard to detect.
35:52
And even with tests that are available, 80% of adults in the U.S. have not had their hearing checked in the last five years.
35:59
To give you insight into your hearing health we're introducing a clinically-validated Hearing Test
36:05
with your AirPods Pro and iPhone. It's a simple five-minute check you can take from the comfort of your own home.
36:11
All you need to do is tap the screen when you hear a series of tones at different volumes and frequencies.
36:17
The Hearing Test builds on learnings from the Apple Hearing Study, and was developed using large-scale, real-world data.
36:24
And it was validated against the clinical gold standard of pure-tone audiometry. Once you're done, you'll see easy-to-understand results
36:31
in a personalized hearing profile. And like the rest of your health data, these results will be stored privately and securely
36:39
in the Health app, where you can take regular tests, learn more about hearing loss,
36:44
and share your results with your healthcare provider. Learning if you have hearing loss is a critical step
36:50
to getting the hearing assistance you need, which can often be challenging due to high cost and a limited audio experience.
36:58
And global research shows hearing loss often goes untreated. In fact, the Apple Hearing Study revealed
37:04
that a staggering 75% of people diagnosed with hearing loss haven't received the assistive support they need.
37:11
So we are really excited to announce that this fall AirPods Pro will have a clinical-grade over-the-counter Hearing Aid feature.
37:19
We're adding this groundbreaking capability to help more than one billion people living with mild to moderate hearing loss.
37:26
After you take a Hearing Test, your AirPods Pro are transformed into your a personalized Hearing Aid-
37:32
boosting the specific sounds you need in real time, like parts of speech or elements within your environment.
37:38
This will allow you to hear your surroundings better, to help keep you safe and connect you with people nearby
37:44
so it's even easier to hear and engage in conversations. - [muffled] Happy birthday, Mom.
37:53
[clear audio] We're here to celebrate you. And I am so proud
37:59
to be called your son. Sumbul: And with the amazing audio quality of AirPods Pro, your hearing profile is automatically applied to music,
38:08
movies, and phone calls across all your devices without needing to adjust any settings at all.
38:14
We are so excited for these updates coming to AirPods Pro 2 delivering the world's first all-in-one experience
38:21
with active Hearing Protection, a clinical-grade Hearing Test, and an easy-to-use, professional-grade Hearing Aid.
38:29
Building on years of impactful work, these innovations are driven by our unique integration of hardware and software
38:36
and are something only Apple can deliver. We expect to receive clearance from the FDA and other regulators soon,
38:43
with availability of the Hearing Test and Hearing Aid features this fall in over 100 countries and regions,
38:49
including the U.S., Germany, and Japan. These features will be available in a software update
38:54
coming to AirPods Pro 2 and iOS 18 to help make hearing health significantly more approachable for so many people.
39:02
Now, I'll pass it back to Kate. Kate: These are the breakthrough updates and category-defining innovations
39:10
that take the entire AirPods product line to the next level. With the best open-ear audio performance ever in AirPods 4,

44:24
Sri Santhanam: Running powerful experiences like Apple Intelligence on-device needs a chip with substantial high-performance compute.
44:32
It needs memory to store large models and bandwidth to access them quickly.
44:37
And of course, phenomenal energy efficiency. So we're bringing our latest breakthroughs,
44:43
and jumping two generations ahead– from A16 Bionic in iPhone 15 to A18,
44:49
our brand-new chip, created specifically for iPhone 16. A18 features an upgraded, 16-core Neural Engine
44:57
that is optimized for running large generative models. This Neural Engine is up to two times faster for machine learning.
45:06
And it's not just the Neural Engine. We also upgraded A18's memory subsystem,
45:12
including 17% more system memory bandwidth. This is critical to give the chip the fastest, most efficient access
45:20
to our generative models, as well as drive the performance of Apple Intelligence.

Craig Federighi: Your iPhone is the most personal product in your life. It's part of so many things that make you, you–
47:27
like your relationships and messages, your photos and memories, your calendar, notes, and more.
47:34
Now, we're bringing together that personal context with the power of generative models
47:40
to deliver intelligence that understands you. And we're doing it in a way that protects your privacy.
47:47
Apple Intelligence is the personal intelligence system at the heart of the iPhone 16 line-up
47:53
with the ability to understand and create language as well as images, and take action on your behalf to simplify daily tasks.
48:02
And each of these powerful capabilities is grounded in your personal context.
48:07
This is only possible thanks to our unique integration of hardware and software.
48:13
Apple Intelligence draws on the immense power of our silicon to run multiple generative models on the iPhone in your pocket.
48:21
These models are built by Apple and fine-tuned for your everyday iPhone experiences.
48:27
And they adapt dynamically to your current activity. For more computationally intensive tasks,
48:33
Apple Intelligence can unlock even more intelligence with Private Cloud Compute.
48:39
Private Cloud Compute maintains the privacy and security of your iPhone, while giving you access to generative models
48:45
much larger than what fits in your pocket today. It runs on servers we have built especially with Apple silicon.
48:53
Protecting your personal information when accessing server-based intelligence requires a fundamental breakthrough in how these systems are built,
49:01
and Private Cloud Compute delivers just that. When you draw on Private Cloud Compute
49:07
your data is never stored or shared with Apple. It's used only to fulfill your request.
49:13
And in a first for the industry, independent experts can continuously verify this privacy promise.
49:21
This is an extraordinary step forward for privacy in AI. Plus, Apple silicon servers deliver world-class energy efficiency.
49:31
And like all our data centers, they run on 100% renewable electricity as part of Apple 2030,
49:38
our commitment to make Apple carbon neutral across our entire footprint.
49:43
Apple Intelligence is integrated throughout the system, across so many of the apps you use day to day.
49:50
Let's take a look at four ways that Apple Intelligence will transform so much of what you do with your iPhone,
49:56
like how you communicate and express yourself. Starting with Writing Tools.
50:02
We're deeply integrating them into iOS, making them accessible virtually everywhere you type.
50:08
So you'll be able to rewrite hastily written notes into a polished dinner party invite,
50:13
adjust the tone of that Slack message to your boss to sound a little more professional,
50:19
or proofread your latest review on Goodreads before posting it to your fellow book worms.
50:25
Though sometimes, the best way to get your point across isn't with words, it's with emoji.
50:31
And you'll be able to create new emoji simply by typing a description, giving you the perfect response for your group thread.
50:39
With endless possibilities, you can let your imagination run wild. Or create fun, original images with Image Playground.
50:48
Along with a new dedicated app on iPhone, it'll be integrated right into apps like Messages.
50:54
Next, iPhone holds so many of your photos, and Apple Intelligence will give you brand-new ways
51:01
to relive precious memories. Suppose you've got a photo in mind that you took ages ago,
51:07
but can't remember exactly when or where. Just describe it, by typing something like "Shani dancing in a red dress,"
51:15
and Apple Intelligence will find it for you. It even works for getting straight to a specific moment in a video.
51:23
You'll also be able to create an entire movie to revisit a favorite memory, just by typing a description of whatever you have in mind,
51:31
like "the kids learning to crochet with Aunt Fiona." Apple Intelligence will automatically find relevant photos and videos
51:38
and smartly arrange them into a storyline. We hope you'll enjoy building your own collection of movies
51:45
that you can share and relive for years to come. Now, let's talk about how Apple Intelligence on iPhone 16
51:53
will help you prioritize and focus on your most essential communication. In Mail, it'll be easy to quickly survey your inbox.
52:02
Instead of seeing the first couple lines of your emails, you'll see summaries that convey the most useful information.
52:08
Your notifications will be summarized too, helping you quickly get the gist.
52:14
And priority notifications will be placed at the top of your stack so you won't miss a last-minute invitation.
52:21
All throughout our day, we turn to iPhone to help us get things done. And a great way to accelerate everyday tasks is with Siri.
52:30
Apple Intelligence marks the start of a new era for Siri, and makes it more natural, more contextually relevant,
52:37
and more personal to you. With richer language understanding, Siri will follow along if you stumble over your words.
52:45
- Hey, Siri, who was the architect behind the museum of– wait, no, not the museum.
52:50
The Palace of Fine Arts? Siri: Bernard Maybeck designed the Palace of Fine Arts.
52:56
Craig: And you'll always have the option to type to Siri– great for those times when you want to make your request
53:02
a little more discreetly. With its new, expansive knowledge about features and settings,
53:07
Siri will give you step-by-step guidance on how to do something on your iPhone, like deleting duplicate photos from your library.
53:15
This will be great for everyone, and especially for anyone new to iPhone. And there's so much more to come.
53:22
Siri will be able to tap into your personal context to help you in ways that are unique to you,
53:28
like pulling up the recommendation for the TV show that your brother sent you last month. And Siri will gain on-screen awareness,
53:35
so when your friend texts you about a new album, you'll be able to simply say, "play that."
53:40
And it will be able to take hundreds of new actions in your apps, like updating a friend's contact card with his new address
53:47
or adding a set of photos to a specific album. With Siri's personal context understanding and action capabilities,
53:54
you'll be able to simply say, "send Erica the photos from Saturday's barbecue" and Siri will dig up the photos and send them right off.
54:03
With new ways to express yourself and relive memories, along with tools to help you prioritize and focus so you can get more done,
54:10
Apple Intelligence is going to transform so much of what you do with iPhone.
54:15
Apple Intelligence will be available as a free software update. The first set of features will be available in beta next month,
54:24
with more features rolling out in the months to come. We're starting with U.S. English in most regions around the world.
54:30
We'll add localized English for Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the UK in December.
54:37
We're working to expand Apple Intelligence to more languages like Chinese, French, Japanese, and Spanish,
54:45
and will be rolling these out next year. And this is just the beginning. As we look ahead, we'll continue to bring more personal intelligence
54:53
to the apps and experiences that you use every day. Now, I'd like to show you something really cool
55:00
that we've created especially for iPhone 16. Your iPhone is with you everywhere you go,
55:06
and we wanted to give you the ability to instantly learn about everything you see.
55:11
Visual intelligence is just a click away with iPhone 16's new Camera Control
55:17
that Kaiann introduced earlier. Let me show you. Suppose you're out for a stroll and you stumble upon a restaurant
55:24
you haven't been to before. Just click and hold the Camera Control and point your iPhone.
55:30
With just a click– boom, your iPhone instantly pulls up restaurant hours,
55:35
ratings, and quick options to check out the menu or make a reservation. And you can learn more with just a tap.
55:43
Awesome. And say you come across a flyer for an interesting event.
55:48
Just click! And you can add it to your calendar. Details about the event title, time and date,
55:54
and location are automatically entered for you. And then there's that cute little puppy you see at the park.
56:00
What kind of dog is that? Click! And now you know.
56:07
All of this is done privately, using a combination of on-device intelligence and Apple services that never store your images.
56:15
And there's more. The Camera Control is also your gateway to third-party tools,
56:21
making it super fast and easy to tap into their specific domain expertise.
56:26
So if you come across a bike that looks exactly like the kind you're in the market for, just tap to search Google for where you can buy something similar.
56:35
And if you're studying notes from your college lecture and get stuck on a particular concept,
56:41
just use the Camera Control to ask ChatGPT for guidance. Nice.
56:47
Of course, you're always in control of when third-party tools are used, and what information is shared.
56:54
So that's visual intelligence, enabled by the new Camera Control on iPhone 16,
57:00
helping you learn about your surroundings and get answers to your questions faster than ever before.
57:06
It's coming to the Camera Control later this year. The Camera Control also elevates the camera experience on iPhone 16.
57:14
To tell you all about it, here's Piyush. ♪ ♪
57:20
Piyush Pratik: iPhone is the world's most popular camera. It has profoundly impacted the world by making it effortless
57:27
for everyone to capture amazing photos and videos. Let's start with a closer look at the Camera Control.
57:33
It's designed for an amazing camera experience that brings you new ways to capture your photos quickly and easily.
57:41
The Camera Control is easy to use in landscape or portrait.
57:46
It's flush to the surface, covered by a sapphire crystal with a smooth texture,
57:52
and surrounded by a color-matched stainless steel trim. The Camera Control elegantly blends hardware and software.
57:59
When you click, it launches the Camera. And once in the Camera, you don't need to adjust your grip to take a photo.
58:06
Just click again, so you don't miss the moment. With a click and hold, you can do a quick video recording.
58:14
The Camera Control is packed with innovation. A tactile switch enables the click experience.
58:20
A high-precision force sensor interacts with the Taptic Engine, ensuring responsive haptic feedback
58:26
like in a mechanical camera shutter. Additionally, a small multi-pixel capacitive sensor
58:32
and signal processor under the sapphire crystal recognize touch gestures.
58:38
Thanks to this innovative design, the Camera Control can distinguish between a full click and a lighter press.
58:46
While you click to take a photo, a lighter press reveals an all-new clean preview
58:52
that dissolves other UI elements, helping you focus on framing the shot.
58:58
A light press also brings up a new overlay that allows quick access to useful camera functions.
59:05
By sliding your finger on the Camera Control, you can adjust controls, like zoom.
59:10
When you press lightly twice, you can see other controls. Then simply slide to the control you want,
59:17
and press lightly again to select it, like the depth of field to compose a stunning portrait.
59:24
Apps like Snapchat are also leveraging the Camera Control to create new experiences,
59:30
like quickly sharing the moment with your friends or groups. And that's the new Camera Control on iPhone 16,
59:38
making it even easier to capture memories and access visual intelligence.
59:44
iPhone 16 also has a phenomenal 48MP Main camera,
59:49
that offers incredible flexibility. You can maximize resolution with a 48MP photo,
59:56
with four times more resolution than the camera on iPhone 14. So you can capture fine details in the scene,
1:00:03
like this rocky coastline. The Main Camera image pipeline can also fuse a super-high resolution image
1:00:11
with an image that's been optimized for light capture by grouping every four pixels into a larger pixel.
1:00:18
The result is a 24MP photo that balances image quality,
1:00:24
light and detail, and a smaller file size that's great for storing and sharing.
1:00:29
Computational photography also allows us to flex this Main camera beyond its fixed lens.
1:00:36
We use the middle 12 megapixels of the sensor to deliver a 2x Telephoto option with full-resolution photos.
1:00:44
This 2x Telephoto option has a faster aperture than any previous dedicated 2x Telephoto camera on iPhone,
1:00:52
and can capture up to 1.6 times more light. The capability to capture 48MP photos
1:01:00
and optical-quality 2x telephoto images makes this Main Camera a 48MP Fusion camera.
1:01:08
This 2x Telephoto even has even has a separate image pipeline that delivers incredible quality with Deep Fusion,
1:01:15
zero shutter lag, and great low-light performance. And it captures 4K60 video in Dolby Vision HDR with optical quality.
1:01:25
iPhone 16 also has a new Ultra Wide camera, now with autofocus.
1:01:31
People love the Ultra Wide camera for its versatility, from capturing more of the scene,
1:01:37
to creative framings such as taking your own picture with it, which is so easy now with the Camera Control.
1:01:43
With a larger aperture and bigger pixels, the new Ultra Wide camera can capture up to 2.6 times more light
1:01:51
for even higher image quality, especially in low-light situations.
1:01:56
The new Ultra Wide camera also enables macro photography. So you can get really close to the subject and capture impressive details
1:02:05
like on this frog's skin and this mantis that looks so majestic in macro.
1:02:12
With macro and the 2x Telephoto zoom enabled by the 48 MP Fusion camera,
1:02:17
iPhone 16 users will get the equivalent of four lenses in their pocket. And we're pushing things further with spatial capture on iPhone 16.
1:02:27
The new camera design enables us to get stereoscopic information from the Ultra Wide and Fusion cameras
1:02:34
for capturing spatial videos. And, for the very first time on iPhone, we can also capture spatial photos!
1:02:42
It's so powerful to preserve your precious moments with spatial photos and videos
1:02:47
like your kids' first steps or a family vacation, and relive them for years to come on Apple Vision Pro.
1:02:54
iPhone 16 also makes audio quality better. Using powerful machine learning algorithms,
1:03:01
we can reduce unwanted wind noise from your videos. - Hey! I'm getting that classic San Francisco breeze.
1:03:10
Sorry if it's loud. I'm having a great trip. I miss you guys! I'll see you when I get back.
1:03:16
Piyush: Once you've captured your moments, the true magic is enjoying them later. And we're elevating the entire experience with iOS 18.
1:03:25
The redesigned Photos app can automatically organize your library into beautiful and useful collections
1:03:32
like groups of your favorite people, trips, and so much more. Because everyone's library is unique,
1:03:40
the Photos app is now customizable. So you can reorder collections and pin the ones you access frequently.
1:03:47
With Clean Up coming with Apple Intelligence, you can easily remove distracting objects in photos,
1:03:53
even their reflections and shadows. iPhone 16 features so many exciting camera upgrades–
1:04:01
Camera Control, 48MP Fusion camera, the equivalent of four lenses including macro,
1:04:08
spatial capture, and more. Now, back to Kaiann.
1:04:15
Kaiann: A18 drives Camera and Apple Intelligence features. Our amazing silicon also benefits world-class gaming.
1:04:24
We pair the powerful performance and efficiency of A18 with new system optimizations,
1:04:30
including our thermal design. We updated the main logic board, centralizing the chip placement
1:04:35
and optimizing the surrounding architecture. We also added a thermal sub-structure to dissipate heat,
1:04:42
made from 100% recycled aluminum. As a result, iPhone 16 delivers up to 30% higher sustained performance for gaming.
1:04:52
A18 also supports hardware-accelerated ray tracing. This is used by games such as War Thunder Mobile,
1:05:00
to more accurately represent the reflection of the sun on the water. Hardware acceleration can run ray tracing
1:05:08
at up to five times higher frame rates than with software-based ray tracing allowing A18 to run these graphics smoothly.
1:05:16
Here, ray tracing is used to create realistic shadows and reflections.
1:05:21
These techniques aren't possible to run in real time without hardware acceleration.
1:05:27
iPhone 16 will also support the AAA games that were previously only available
1:05:33
for iPhone 15 Pro, like Resident Evil 7 Biohazard that launched earlier this year
1:05:39
and Assassin's Creed Mirage. They run great on iPhone and work seamlessly with controllers.
1:05:46
And today, we're incredibly excited to introduce the next-generation leading game from Tencent–
1:05:52

Here's Joz to tell you more. ♪ ♪
1:13:14
Greg "Joz" Joswiak: iPhone 16 Pro has a stunning new design with innovations inside and out.
1:13:21
It starts with a big improvement to the gorgeous Pro displays– they're even larger at 6.3-inches on iPhone 16 Pro,
1:13:30
and 6.9-inches on iPhone 16 Pro Max for the largest iPhone display ever,
1:13:37
helping you see more and do more. We did this, while minimizing product growth,
1:13:42
by developing the thinnest borders on any Apple product. With larger displays, ProMotion with adaptive refresh rates
1:13:50
up to 120Hz, Always-On for important information at a glance, and amazing durability with our latest-generation Ceramic Shield,
1:13:59
these are by far our best iPhone displays ever. iPhone 16 Pro uses exceptionally high quality Grade 5 Titanium,
1:14:08
which provides one of the best strength-to-weight ratios of any metal and is nearly half the weight of stainless steel.
1:14:15
It's stronger and more scratch resistant than lower grades of titanium that others have used. And it features a beautiful new micro-blasted texture.
1:14:24
iPhone 16 Pro comes in four stunning finishes: a darker Black Titanium,
1:14:30
a brighter White Titanium, Natural Titanium, and a beautiful new Desert Titanium.
1:14:38
It has a warmer hue on the band that's elegantly contrasted with the softer color on the back glass.
1:14:45
iPhone 16 Pro maximizes thermal capacity with a new machined chassis
1:14:50
made from 100% recycled aluminum, which is bonded to the titanium frame using solid state diffusion.
1:14:57
It's combined with a graphite clad aluminum sub-structure, creating an innovative architecture that enables up to 20% improvement
1:15:05
in sustained performance. This is crucial for efficiently running advanced on-device features
1:15:11
like Apple Intelligence and high-performance gaming. Battery optimizations, larger batteries,
1:15:17
advanced power management, and the remarkable efficiency of Apple silicon provide fantastic battery life.
1:15:25
In fact, iPhone 16 Pro Max has the best iPhone battery life ever.
1:15:31
iPhone 16 Pro is built from the ground up for Apple Intelligence. All the Apple Intelligence capabilities you heard about earlier
1:15:39
enhance the Pro experience like never before. We all rely on multiple apps to get work done
1:15:46
and collaborate with our team. If you need to quickly find an important detail, but can't remember where it was shared,
1:15:53
Siri will use your personal semantic index to quickly locate the information you're looking for.
1:16:00
If you record a meeting, Apple Intelligence will generate a summary from the transcript.
1:16:05
And when it's time to update everyone on the latest status, you'll be able to use it to help rewrite your note in a more professional tone.
1:16:12
And Siri's new action capabilities will be awesome for pros. Like for photographers, who will be able to ask Siri
1:16:18
to pull up a specific shot from their library and then apply the edit to the photo in Darkroom.
1:16:24
And when scouting a location for a photoshoot, photographers will be able to use the Camera Control to quickly get suggestions
1:16:31
on how to enhance the space and achieve their vision. Apple Intelligence will allow you to accomplish even more while on the go.
1:16:38
And this is just the beginning. Apple silicon unlocks an amazing set of features found only on iPhone 16 Pro.
1:16:46
Let's go back to Sri to hear more about our remarkable new Pro chip.
1:16:54
Sri: Just like A18 is key to enabling iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Pro's unique performance and feature requirements
1:17:02
demanded a new Pro chip. This is A18 Pro.
1:17:07
It's even faster and more efficient than A18, and it enables many of the features that are unique to iPhone 16 Pro.
1:17:15
A18 Pro is also built with second-generation 3-nanometer transistors. Our chips are the first smartphone chips in the world
1:17:24
to use these smaller transistors with better density, performance, and efficiency.
1:17:29
A18 Pro also has the new 16-core Neural Engine that powers amazing on-device performance for Apple Intelligence.
1:17:37
This incredibly powerful Neural Engine excels at generative AI workloads.
1:17:42
Compared to the Neural Engine in A17 Pro, it's faster and more efficient,
1:17:47
and is supported by a 17% increase in total system memory bandwidth.
1:17:53
It's designed hand in hand with Apple Intelligence for even better performance.
1:17:59
Combined with the increased memory bandwidth, Apple Intelligence features run up to 15% faster than on A17 Pro.
1:18:08
The updated memory subsystem improves graphics performance as well. When paired with the new, faster 6-core GPU of A18 Pro,
1:18:17
this helps the GPU to run up to 20% faster than A17 Pro.
1:18:22
This takes AAA games even further with A18 Pro. Thanks specifically to new enhancements to the GPU architecture,
1:18:30
hardware acceleration can perform ray tracing up to two times faster than A17 Pro.
1:18:37
A18 Pro has the highest performance implementation of our latest 6-core CPU
1:18:42
with two performance cores and four efficiency cores. The new CPU is up to 15% faster than A17 Pro,
1:18:51
and is capable of delivering the same performance using 20% less power compared to A17 Pro.
1:18:58
Compared to A18, it's backed by larger caches for better performance in the most demanding apps and games.
1:19:05
This is the fastest CPU in any smartphone. The new CPU also has next-generation ML accelerators
1:19:13
that help power Apple Intelligence. They're now directly programmable for high-efficiency,
1:19:19
high throughput, and low-latency computations. A18 Pro also has advanced media features
1:19:25
that are available only on our pro models, like the new advanced display engine for ProMotion and Always-On.
1:19:33
A18 Pro also enables faster USB 3 speeds and ProRes video recording.
1:19:38
Additionally, A18 Pro has a new video encoder and a new image signal processor
1:19:44
which together, process two times the amount of data for super fast encoding and improved efficiency for video.
1:19:51
As you can see, we designed A18 Pro to enable all the advanced capabilities of iPhone 16 Pro.
1:19:58
It also powers never-before-seen camera features. Here's Della to tell you about some incredible advancements.
1:20:05
♪ ♪
1:20:14
Della Huff: iPhone 16 Pro empowers creativity across photos and videos, thanks to the tight integration of hardware, software, and intelligence.
1:20:23
First, let's talk about photography. Our Pro models push the limits of how we capture the world around us,
1:20:29
and iPhone 16 Pro brings more resolution, control, and customization than ever.
1:20:34
iPhone 16 Pro has a new 48MP Fusion camera and an innovative Apple Camera Interface
1:20:40
that delivers fast and efficient data transfer from the sensor to the chip.
1:20:46
The new 48MP Fusion camera has a second-generation quad-pixel sensor
1:20:51
that can read data two times faster, enabling zero shutter lag for 48MP ProRAW and HEIF photos.
1:20:59
So you can capture this flowing dress at the exact moment with uncompromised detail
1:21:05
or even when your subject won't stay still. We know that high-resolution matters in a variety of scenes,
1:21:12
so we're introducing a new 48MP Ultra Wide camera. It has a new quad-pixel sensor for high resolution shots with autofocus.
1:21:21
You can capture so much more detail in wider-angle shots or when you want to get up close for a gorgeous macro shot.
1:21:29
The 5x Telephoto camera, with our longest focal length, is a huge hit.
1:21:34
It lets you get closer even from far away with stunning quality. And now you get the innovative tetraprism design
1:21:42
on iPhone 16 Pro Max and iPhone 16 Pro. Along with the new 48MP Fusion and Ultra Wide,
1:21:49
iPhone 16 Pro gets three new cameras. With the Camera Control, you can quickly open the Camera app
1:21:55
and slide between lenses for the perfect shot, like with the 5x Telephoto. Plus, there's nothing like having a dedicated, go-to control
1:22:04
for your camera. It makes the Pro camera system more versatile than ever, letting you stay immersed in the capture experience
1:22:10
while you dial in the depth of field and exposure. Camera Control will be updated later this year with a two-stage shutter
1:22:17
that can automatically lock focus and exposure on the subject. Just press lightly to reframe the shot without losing subject focus.
1:22:25
We're also making it effortless to bring your creative vision to life. Our latest generation of Photographic Styles
1:22:32
lets you express your creativity like never before. They begin with advancements that go deeper into the image pipeline.
1:22:39
We can understand skin tones and locally adjust color, highlights, and shadows, all in real time,
1:22:45
which allows us to push the creative range further. So now you can personalize how you or your subject appears in photos
1:22:52
with incredible nuance. This is not just a one-size-fits all approach.
1:22:57
The powerful imaging upgrades also enable more creative styles. These provide different moods
1:23:03
and are based on past and present photography aesthetics. The adjustments are applied to specific colors,
1:23:09
like this gorgeous style, and don't just add one shade to the entire scene. There are stunning black-and-white options
1:23:16
that look great in a studio or outdoors. And this natural look with dramatic, rich tones,
1:23:22
and many more. You can further personalize all of the styles with a new, simple control pad
1:23:28
that simultaneously adjusts tone and color– something that can be challenging to edit even with pro workflows.
1:23:36
You can also change the style after capture, a big step up from original Photographic Styles.
1:23:41
And with the Camera Control, you can slide through all of the styles to find the right one for your shot.
1:23:47
With the power of A18 Pro, you can see the style applied during live preview, so this is like professional color grading in real time.

You can use 4K120 in Slo-mo or video mode. And now you don't have to make that upfront decision on frame rate.
1:26:31
You can adjust the playback speed after capture in the new Photos app. There's a quarter-speed playback,
1:26:38
a new half-speed option that really adds a wonderful, dreamy effect, or you can bring it back to normal speed.
1:26:46
There's also a one-fifth speed option that corresponds to 24-frames-per-second playback.
1:26:51
These playback speed controls are great for easy, on-the-go editing. And with Camera Control, you can quickly capture 4K120 in HDR.

iPhone 16 Pro brings new hardware, software, and intelligence innovations previously unseen on smartphones.
1:27:49
iPhone 16 Pro has four studio-quality mics for higher quality audio recording.
1:27:55
They provide a much lower noise floor, which means you get more true-to-life audio with reduced noise.
1:28:01
This is great for vocal and acoustic recordings. And it makes everything that uses the microphone simply sound better.
1:28:09
We're also enabling Spatial Audio capture during video recording for a more immersive experience
1:28:15
when listening with AirPods or watching your spatial videos on Apple Vision Pro, or even your home theater setup.
1:28:22
The new studio quality mics and Spatial Audio Capture enable creative sound editing with our new Audio Mix feature.
1:28:30
This is an industry first, and it's powered by advanced intelligence. Audio Mix uses machine learning to identify and separate
1:28:39
background elements from speech and lets you choose from three voice options.
1:28:44
Say people off-camera are talking during the capture. - No, it's your grandma's bundt cake. - Pancakes times two.

1:31:12
Erik: When we were told that the iPhone can now shoot in 4K, 120-frames-per-second,
1:31:17
we wanted to do a music video shot in slow motion.
1:31:28
Shooting 4K, 120 really helped us to slow down reality.
1:31:34
To slow down the elements. Slow down The Weeknd's movement.

1:31:57
It's hard to miss with him. I love shooting portraits on the iPhone. You can get really close to the subject.
1:32:03
Becomes really intimate. And with the new photo styles, you could dial back contrast and you could punch it up if you need,
1:32:09
so it's super helpful to just see it as you're shooting.
1:32:18
I really think the Ultra Wide captures such a cool and unique perspective. I definitely get sharper detail with the Ultra Wide lens
1:32:25
because of the new 48MP. And with Camera Control, it allows anyone to just access
1:32:31
so many of the features– you know, your exposure, your focal lengths, photo styles.
1:32:39
With just a few taps in Camera Control, I can make technical decisions in real time.
1:32:44
And if a moment comes up in between takes, we just took up the phone, and we just started shooting.
1:32:52
Erik: We can get those moments when we see them, and it won't be just a memory. Two, one, action.
1:32:58
